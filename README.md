# Detectify

This  Android app allows users to detect objects in real-time using both the front and back cameras with the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The app provides a smooth interface for switching cameras and visualizing detected objects with bounding boxes and labels. It is optimized for fast, accurate detection on mobile devices.

## Features
1. **Dual Camera Support**: Easily switch between the front and back cameras for object detection.
2. **Real-Time Object Detection**: Utilizes the YOLO model to detect multiple objects in real-time with high accuracy.
3. **Bounding Boxes and Labels**: Detected objects are highlighted with bounding boxes and class labels for better visualization.
4. **Efficient Processing**: Powered by TensorFlow Lite for smooth and efficient model inference on Android devices.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with Jetpack Compose for a clean, responsive, and intuitive UI.

## Technical Implementation

### YOLO Model Integration
- The app integrates the YOLOv5 model converted to TensorFlow Lite for fast, on-device inference.
- Models are optimized for mobile devices to balance accuracy and performance.

### Object Visualization
- Detected objects are overlaid with dynamic bounding boxes and labels.
- The UI updates instantly with every frame, ensuring smooth object tracking.
### Performance Optimization
- Efficient use of background threads for model processing to keep the UI responsive.
- Uses TensorFlow Lite’s GPU delegate for accelerated performance (if available).
